After completing my undergraduate degree in computer science, I found my passion for security in quality assurance, reverse engineering, and secure coding. I continued to broaden my intellectual curiosity by pursuing studies in cybersecurity. Through my studies, I have gained an understanding of how to defend individuals, organizations, and environments from potential threats. 

From analyzing insider threats, detecting anomalies in vulnerability scanners, and policy creation, I attained further comprehension of protecting entities.
