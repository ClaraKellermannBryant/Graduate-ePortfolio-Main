The Secure Coding category consists of best practices and methods to protect software. Parameterized queries, encryption, clean code best practices, and incorporating recommendations for CVE mitigation are discussed. This category is pertinent to various areas including database and application design, code injection prevention, overflow detection, and other concepts in software development. 

Secure Coding produces effective measures in defending against software exploits and are recommended to use throughout the security development lifecycle. An example of Secure Coding can be input validation or code sanitization for blocking a JavaScript injection attack. It is then due to best practices in the Secure Coding category where engineers can find robust solutions to numerous software security issues.
