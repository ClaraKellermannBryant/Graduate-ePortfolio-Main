The Networking category includes Cisco IOS fundamentals, 5G network security, and working with different protocols. The protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, ARP, FTP, PDCP, SMP, POP3, EAP, and SSH. In utilizing these protocols, security practitioners can protect networks and defend against network-based attacks. In addition, practitioners can implement the protocols with cryptographic algorithms associated to protect data in transit.
