  The Encryption category has demonstrated how certain cryptographic algorithms can be used to secure applications and networks. RSA, Diffie-Hellman, AES, SNOW, and cipher fundamentals are included within this category. My understanding of encryption has then improved through learning SQLite protection basics to fully mastering the ways cryptographic algorithms are developed. 

Encryption provides sufficient protection towards data confidentiality and data integrity, however, may not be enough for advanced persistent threats. Nonetheless, encryption methods continue to be significant for protecting data in transit and ensuring sensitive items are not in plaintext.
