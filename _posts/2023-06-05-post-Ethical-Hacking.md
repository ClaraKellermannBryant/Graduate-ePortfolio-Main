In the Ethical Hacking category, I took an approach to understanding how malware and malicious tools are created. With this approach, I was able to dissect the adversarial mindset for establishing advanced defenses against cybercriminals. 

The projects for the offensive side detail how a sophisticated attacker may develop malware or tools that are commonly present in underground markets. These projects include developing an ARP cache poisoner for Man-In-The-Middle Attacks, creating a port scanner in C#, and creating a packet sniffer in Python. From these projects, I learned how to recognize the origins of malicious activity for preparing an organization's security posture in the future.

The projects for the defensive side consist of utilizing defense-in-depth strategies, technical controls, and documentation. The defense-in-depth strategies use the layering technique with IDS/IPS capabilities. 

What I attained from the ethical hacking category includes social engineering fundamentals, physical attacks, hardware hacking, and other penetration testing techniques.
