In the Ethical Hacking category, I took an approach to understanding how malware and malicious tools are created. With this approach, I was able to dissect the adversarial mindset for establishing advanced defenses against cybercriminals. 

The projects for the offensive side detail how a sophisticated attacker may develop malware or tools that are commonly present in underground markets. These projects include developing an ARP cache poisoner for Man-In-The-Middle Attacks, creating a port scanner in C#, and creating a packet sniffer in Python.
