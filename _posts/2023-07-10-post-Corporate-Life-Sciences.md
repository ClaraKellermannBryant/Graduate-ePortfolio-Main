The Corporate and Life Sciences Environment category includes workplace security, biosecurity, security awareness, malicious insider prevention, and the elimination of unintentional threats. This category has provided me insight with how adversaries can manipulate real-world circumstances as well as exacerbate problems in the time of crisis. 

It is through understanding corporate and life sciences environments that practitioners can demonstrate the protection of physical security, natural disaster prevention, the eradication of bioweapons, and the elimination of economic espionage.
